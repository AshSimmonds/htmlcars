      This Webpage and HTML LCARS Library are created by
      <a href="https://twitter.com/Xiphoseer">@Xiphoseer</a>, based on the
      original design by Michael Okuda from Star Trek. It is heavily influenced
      in theme by sites such as <a href="https://gtjlcars.de">GTJLCARS</a> or
      <a href="http://www.lcarscom.net/">lcarscom.net</a>, but completely
      independent in terms of source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commercial rights to the LCARS system are (as far as I know) held by
      CBS, as part of other StarTrek asset rights. This means that, while this
      source code will be released under a MIT license, you are likely not allowed
      to use this libray in a commercial setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The font used for headings is the LCARSGTJ3 font available
      <a href="http://gtjlcars.de/LCARSindex/LCARSFONTS.htm">here</a>. It is
      provided as 'freeware' under a custom license, which states the font file
      may not be renamed, modified or sold.
