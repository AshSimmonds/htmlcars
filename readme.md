# HTMLCARS

A HTML/CSS LCARS Framework, based on GUIs from StarTrek.

## Development

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.org)
2. Install [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
3. run `git clone https://github.com/Xiphoseer/htmlcars.git`
4. Go into the `htmlcars` directory
5. run `sass --watch sass:css`

## Info

Yes, I'm aware that it is less then ideal to put compiled css files
in this repository. It is currently layed out like that to allow
for github pages to work. I plan on removing them from this repo,
once I've set up some sort of CI.
